“I was actually on the career path to become an accountant.

“I like math and I loved being creative. The stereotype of the starving artist was all I had to go on when thinking of a future for myself—and I did not want to be starving. I had never actually heard of graphic design until a few days before high school graduation. In college I excelled in my accounting/math courses but it was one class and one teacher that changed my future. This accounting teacher loved accounting—all the debits and credits and double entry journaling stuff made her excited. I looked at her and thought to myself ‘I will never be that excited about accounting.’ From that moment on, all I could imagine was a dreary gray future with an adding machine stuck to my fingertips. Yuck! So I began researching the graphic design industry just to make sure it wasn’t a dying industry—ha! I visited designers and quickly fell in love with the fact that a creative individual could make a living being creative.

“Now, more than 10 years later, I realize that my love for math actually translates into a love for details as a graphic designer. My future is colorful and vibrant. And I will never be stuck inside a dreary cubicle with an adding machine stuck to my fingertips.”

	 “I came into the design field via a battery of career tests. All of them mentioned graphic design as a likely field for me. My response? ‘What’s graphic design?’

“After being assured I didn’t have to draw (this was when computers were being introduced), I felt confident enough to check it. I’ve never looked back.”
