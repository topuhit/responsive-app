Responsive App
---
A lightweight responsive framework for fullscreen web applications.
Built in HTML, CSS3, and javascript.

Supports all modern browsers, IE 9+, iOS. Functions in IE8.

### TODO
 - [ ] Verify IE and Mobile Support
 - [ ] Add build scripts
 - [ ] Add examples

### How it works
The responsive app framework divides the screen realestate into four sections: two responsive panels, headmatter, and main content. See a [demo](https://github.com/topuhit/responsive-app).

![layout](http://raw.github.com/fgassert/responsive-app/master/fullscreen-app-layout.png)

The framework is designed to be easily modified by inserting HTML into these sections. Rather than creating a layout on the fly, the framework relies on static HTML and CSS for better performance.

ra.js monitors window size and moves the respective panels. The main element is a div called `#ra-container`, which slides to the left and right to reveal the side panels when on small screens.

The `#ra-container` element is assigned a class depending on the screen mode:
```
.ra-large /* for normal window sizes */
.ra-small /* for small window sizes */
.ra-fullscreen /* when in full screen mode */
```

In addition ra.css defines two classes: `.ra-hidewhenlarge` and `.ra-hidewhensmall` for elements that you only want to appear when screen mode is large or small.

Use
===
### Option 1: Edit the html

Clone the master branch. All dependencies are held in the `_site` folder.

**Edit these files:**

`_site/index.html`: Base html. Rather than creating a layout on the fly, the framework relies on static HTML and CSS for better performance [read the source](https://github.com/fgassert/responsive-app/blob/master/_site/index.html) to see where to insert content.

`_site/css/style.css`: Additional styling information, edit this document to change framework appearance

**Core files:**

`_site/css/ra.css`: Core css.

`_site/js/ra.js`: Core javascript

`_site/js/classList.min.js`: [classList shim](https://github.com/eligrey/classList.js/blob/master/classList.js) for older browser support

### Option 2: Jekyll + GitHub Pages

The Responsive App framework is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) which uses the [Liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org) templating engine. 

Fork this repository, switch to the `gh-pages` branch and replace `_includes/main-content.html` with your own content.
Go to http://{username}/github.io/responsive-app/ to see the changes!

`_templates/ra.html` is the main template for the Responsive app framework.

`_includes/*` holds the html content for the app. Edit these files and `css/style.css`.

GitHub Pages and Jekyll will automatically compile the `gh-pages` repository into a static site located in the `_site` folder. The `index.html` file in the base directory tells Jekyll to use the `ra.html` template which then loads up the content in the `_includes` folder. Any non-Jekyll files in the base directory including the `css` and `js` folders will be copied into the `_site` directory. 

ra.js Options, methods, and events
===

Initialize the Responsive App framework using `ra = new ra({options})`.

**Default options:**
```
{
  minWidth:640,        // minimum window width (px) for screen size to count as large, 
                       //  when window width is smaller than minWidth the layout will be condensed
  panelWidth:284,      // panel width (px) in both large screen and small screen layouts.
  panel2MaxHeight:150, // panel 2 max content height (px) when on screen bottom (large screen layout).
  panel1:true,         // toggle panel 1 on/off
  panel2:true          // toggle panel 2 on/off
}
```

**Methods:**

The `ra` object supports the following methods
```
ra.gotoPanel({panel #})  // When in small screen mode, shifts the view to the given panel
                         //  0: main, 1: left, 2: right
ra.resize()              // Forces ra to recalculate panel sizes
ra.screenSize()          // Returns the current mode (#ra-container.className)
                         //  Small: 'ra-small', Large: 'ra-large', Fullscreen, 'ra-fullscreen'
ra.toggleFullScreen()    // Toggles fullscreen mode. 
                         //  In fullscreen mode the main content fills the entire window
ra.setOptions({options}) // Edits the ra options and recalculates panel appearance
ra.getOptions()           // Returns the current configuration
ra.subPanel({children},{width})	 // Creates a subpanel div in Panel 1 
			 // {children} can be an element or array of elements
			 // see below for details
```

**Events:**

ra.js will dispatch custom events on the `#ra-container` element
```
'ra-screenchange'	// occurs when screen mode changes
'ra-panelchange'	// occurs when panel changes
```

### Subpanels:

Subpanels are full height divs inside the left hand side panel. They increase the width of the panel when shown. These are the only dynamically generated content in ra.js. Create a subpanel with `mypanel = ra.subPanel()`, fill it with `mypanel.el.appendChild({content})` and show it with `mypanel.show()`.

![Subpanel](http://raw.github.com/fgassert/responsive-app/master/fullscreen-app-layout-sub.png)

Attributes and methods
```
mypanel.el		// The DOM element, put your content in here using js
mypanel.show()		// Show the panel
mypanel.hide()		// Hide the panel
mypanel.setWidth({width}) // Set panel width in px
```

Subpanels default to hidden and need to be manually shown with `mypanel.show()`. In addition, they are automatically hidden when the screen mode or current panel changes (Except on IE 8).
